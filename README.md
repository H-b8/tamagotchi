# MY GENERIC EGG YOLK FRIEND (AKA "MY GEY FRIEND")
### An object oriented take on the classic Tamagotchi keychain!

- Stats are randomized on load
- Users can feed, play with, and put their pet to bed
- Playing with your pet will increase happiness, but also make them sleepy and hungry
- Your pet will reject play if they have no energy
- Feeding your pet will fill their tummies and make them happy
- Overfeeding your pet will cause them to lose energy and reject food
- Putting your pet to bed restores energy and increases hunger. But like every living creature, your pet sometimes wakes up in a better or worse mood
- When happines at 0%, your pet will become depressed and only want to sleep
- In a depressed state, your only hope is that your pet might wake up in a good mood and decide to accept food or play
