# MY GENERIC EGG YOLK FRIEND (AKA "MY GEY FRIEND")
### An object oriented take on the classic Tamagotchi keychain!

- Stats are randomized on load
- Users can feed, play with, and put their pet to bed
- Playing with your pet will always increase happiness, but also make them sleepy and hungry
- Your pet will reject play if they have no energy or are too hungry
- Feeding your pet will always fill their tummies and make them happy
- But overfeeding your pet will cause them to lose energy and reject both food and play, leaving their only option to be to sleep it off
- Like every living creature, your pet can wake up in a better mood and recharged, or in a worse mood and even more tired
- When happines is at 0%, your pet will become depressed and only want to sleep
- In a depressed state, your only hope is that your pet might wake up in a good mood and decide to accept food or play
